    info: ! 'The LowLandLions is an organization of professional gaming athletes, which
      originates from the Benelux. Our goal is to nurture aspiring potential and grow
      the next generation of e-Sports athletes.


      Over the last couple of years the ''Lowlands'' has spawned a great deal of talent.
      Unfortunately very few had the opportunity to develop into professional athletes
      due to insufficient support. The LowLandLions gives both new and established talent
      the chance to compete at the highest level under the wings of a well structured
      organization. Based on a select number of criteria, the LowLandLions will continuously
      scout and recruit young potential, and is therefore a representation of the best
      the Benelux has to offer.


      Our goal is to become an ambassador for e-Sports by striving for its main stream
      acceptance for the benefit of professional gamers and gamers alike around the
      world.

      in December 2010, the knockdown started its activities within the game &quot;Allods
      Online&quot;, representing the Empire. Starting from a small group of friends,
      the guild was structured and solidified a strong base, united and determined to
      grow and conquer, along with a renewal policy and merit. On behalf of his faction,
      battled and honored the commitment to achieve victories, always being among the
      most competitive guilds in the game.<br />\n\t\t\t┬á</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t┬á In
      April 2012, seeing that the game Allods Online took a turn too uncertain and not
      meeting the expectations of many members feel the need to explore a new challenge:
      Guild Wars 2. However, keeping the members in Allods Online and having offices
      in both games. With a large rise in the GW2 and considerable expansion in the
      membership appeared opportunities to continue expanding our flag in other games,
      such as League of Legends and Dota 2. Was when we ceased to be a guild (Guild
      knockdown) and we became an institution (knockdown e-Sports).</p>\n\t\t<br /><p>\n\t\t\tToday
      we continue to strive in pursuit of our goals, working hard to achieve the best
      organization. Thus far and showing respect for our opponents, the knockdown continues
      its campaign to write his story.</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t┬á</p>\n\t\t<center>\n<br

    info: ! ' <center> <br /><br /><p>Level is a structured online tournament that is
      centered around high caliber players for a competitive Battlefield experience.
      The 32v32 tournament involves two sides, the Red Team versus the Blue Team. Level
      has its own private battle server, its own private TeamSpeak server and each side
      is provided their own private forums. Level is not a clan, so being in a clan
      is not a problem. Just bring your clanmates along for the ride! </p><br /><p>Tournaments,
      or seasons, are the heart of Level. A season generally lasts between 6-10 weeks
      where every Saturday a battle takes place for 6 hours. At the end of the day the
      teams score up to two points that go toward ultimately crowning a season champion.</p><br
      /><p></p>


      <p>When you sign up you will have the choice to join either the Red Team or the
      Blue Team and you will get a chance to make a difference on the Battlefield. Remember
      that Level is for experienced players only that are capable of working together
      to bring down the enemy. Do you have what it takes?</p>

      <br /><img src="http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i262/Maduo/Profile/AboutMe2.png"
      alt="Various / About Us" /><div style="background:#0d3803;"><div style="border:1px
      solid #000000;"><div style="color:#C1BFBD;">

      This group is mainly composed of a group of casters that are somewhat dedicated
      to casting/streaming during the night time hours.<br />

      Overall, we are just a chill bunch of guys and girls looking to have good times
      and alot of fun. Some of us like to rage, others like to jam, but when it comes
      down to it we all all night owls by heart.<br /><br />

      Arek1985: A great well known caster that started during late 2010. He has built
      an empire upon rpgs, zelda, and mario classics.Whether you''re new to streaming
      or a veteran yourself, you can always find a friendly voice during the early morning
      hours with this caster.<br /><br />

      Mikgaming: A late day, early night caster. Mik is one of those underlooked casters
      around that likes to play old school games and rpgs. His motto is &quot;becoming
      a master, one game at a time&quot; and to this he holds true. Whether you''re
      looking for some old school action or just looking for a chill place to lay low,
      mik''s channel is always a top pick <br /><br />

      Rasher24: Another early night - late night caster, rasher is one of the original
      participants of the mario 64 invitiational and had a fairly impressive run in
      it. She is a big fan of genesis titles and plays strange and peculiar titles.
      Some of her more known playthroughs have been Sonic, Toe Jam &amp; Earl and Banjo
      Tooie. <br /><br />

      Maduo: The founder of Nightwatch, and a late night gamer to boot. Mad plays a
      variety of games, and often goes on tangents and rants from time to time. He is
      most known to be a no-bullshit type person and bans regularly for breaking the
      rules. His likes includes rpgs, strategy, and very cute girls. A Boshy.<br /><br
      />

      PrinceBatman: A Venerable mellow late night caster. Batman is known around jtv
      for playing many mario hacks and his infamous no-death run of mario 1. With a
      chill attitude, his style of &quot;What it is&quot; gaming is unparralled for
      a nice place to sit back and enjoy some classic retro for the night.<br /><br
      />

      WhenChukAttacks: Chuk is one of the more well known users on jtv and a great gamer
      that spans the scope from retro to rockstar. No game is safe for when chuk attacks,
      scores and tables alike will be broken! Chuk is a stalwart denizen of the gaming
      realm and is a fairly good gamer with a relaxing chill and upbeat attitude to
      boot. If you need a good place to sit back and relax chuk''s arcade is definitely
      the place for you. A Boshy. Chuk has recently acquired a new quest of fatherhood,
      as such he will most likely not be casting as much.<br /><br />

      BoydTheMilkman: Boyd is a fun caster that focuses primarily on platformers from
      the past all the way to the present. His easygoing, positive attitude will have
      you coming back time and time again to hang out and enjoy the classics. Come for
      the games, stay for the milk.<br /><br />

      Arjex: This guy is quite an amazing german... or swedish... or australian.. well
      nobody truly knows what an arjex is so who can say where it hails from but arjex
      itself. Arjex plays a wide variety of games, from oldschool 2D platformers to
      strategy based shooters, to rpgs. Come for the accent, stay for the action.<br
      /><br />

      PhillyWild302: If I nicknamed every caster in nightwatch, Philly would be most
      definitely be named giggles. This guy loves to laugh and have a good time. He
      loves to cast retro games and is not afraid to show it by playing some of the
      most obscure titles you''ve ever heard of. Whether you''re on top of the world
      or down in the gutter, popping into Philly''s chat just to say &quot;Hi&quot;
      will always brighten up your day.<br /><br />

      Dark3mx: A fairly new caster, he''s still on a trial basis with nightwatch and
      I''ve personally not seen too much of what he offers. He has been improving his
      casts since day one from the looks of it and shows signs that he wants to become
      a true blue blooded caster here on twitch. From what I''ve seen his playlist is
      consisting of mostly Snes to PS1 classics like Chrono Trigger, Donkey Kong, and
      Chrono Cross (PLAY IT DAMMIT!). Check him out some time and encourage him to strive
      to be even better.<br /><br /></div></div></div>

      A quick lesson.<br />

      ~ is a tilda, in mathematics it usually means &quot;about&quot; or &quot;close
      to&quot;.<br /><br />


      All times were done in EST, also known as Eastern Standard Time. EST is exactly
      3 hours ahead of West Coast time or &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;.<br /><br
      />


      Not all casters that belong to this group live on the east coast.<br /></div></div></div>

    info: ! "About us! \n\nVideo &amp; game content creators from all shape and sizes
      are enjoying a golden era here on the web. It has become an industry where business
      has found its way in. Online video is becoming paid media. Providing us most of
      us with financial benefit. However, the status quo proposed by big business is
      limiting. Now all over people have started to talk about an alternative. This
      conversation has now become a collaboration. And Age of Gaming at the heart of
      it. Restoring the grassroots of content creating: Having fun. Here on the network
      you can join for YouTube Partnership. Or you can submit content right here on
      the site for review. Other networks will tie you down for years. And hold large
      profit margins over your revenue. We comitted those tactics and kept it kosher
      for everyone. This is growing on the idea. Not on merits of community size or
      profit.\nNot just limiting to Youtube though!\nWe love to add you on our Team
      page! e-mail\nToine@ageofgaming.net for the requirements and/or sign ups!\n\n"
